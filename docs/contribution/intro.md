## Projects

:::note
Archived repositories and resources are not included in this documentation!

:::info
GitHub projects have a naming scheme that follows these rules:

- If the repository contains the root directory of a subdomain, it's prefixed with the string:
  `"wrr-"`! (*web root repository*)
- If the repository contains extra website(s) build files, it's prefixed with the string:
  `"wre-"`! (*web root extras*)
- Otherwise, the repository will not include a prefix!

## Style Guides

A style guide covers a set of instructions as to how to write code, comments, and other unique requirements. These
instructions are meant to make collaboration between a wide range of different developers more uniform and easy.

Each project may use its own set of programming languages. Generally, each used language has its own style guide:

- [Markdown (.md) Style Guide](./code/markdown.md)
- [HTML/CSS Style Guide](./code/web.md)
- [JavaScript/PHP/C++ Style Guide](./code/programming-language.md)
- [Batch/Bash Style Guide](./code/command.md)
- [General Style Guide](./code/general.md) (*if none of the previous guides apply*)

## Content Guide

A content guide defines what is to be considered valid content, depending on the type of said content.

:::danger
You **must** make sure to follow these strict Unicode Character limitations
(*for [Private Use Area (PUA) characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas) -
`U+E000` to `U+F8FF`*) in all of the organisation's projects:

- The characters `U+E0DE` (for the **start**) and `U+E1DE` (for the **end**) are used to mark the
start and end of a PUA use - a *PUA wrap* if you will!
- All characters within the range `U+E0DE` to `U+E1DE` - *excluding the head and tail* - are
**forbidden** inside of a *PUA wrap*! You can use them outside a *PUA wrap*!
- All characters within the range `U+E200` to `U+E2FF` are reserved for web-based usage!
  (be it tools that build the raw web files, or the web files themselves)
- All characters within the range `U+E300` to `U+E6FF` are reserved for the *Omniarium transpiler*!
  (These characters are allowed within *Omniarium source files*, but **only if** you do not wrap
  them with the *PUA wrap* used by this organisation!)

**If you wish to use *PUA* characters that are not included within any range in the previous rules,
you must first add a rule to specify the reserved range for the project that belongs to this
organisation!**
:::

:::tip
You may use the online [Unicode Hex converter](https://test.ender.ing/tools/unicode-hex-converter/) for help with
unicode-related values!
:::

### Client Content

All content meant to be served in user-friendly settings (e.g. website UI) falls under the following guidelines:

- Content must be served in English, Arabic, and Hebrew. The contribution will not be accepted until served content is
available in all languages! (*you may ask maintainers to fill in the missing languages for you when you open a pull
request*)
- Content language translations should be done by hand! **You are not allowed to use non-proofread machine-generated
translations!**
- Illustrations and UI design should follow the [Material Design Guidelines](https://m3.material.io/)!

:::note
Documentation is not required to follow language-related content guidelines. It can be written only in English!
:::

### Developer Content

All content meant to be seen only by developers (an API response, commands, etc.) falls under the following guidelines:

- Content must served only in English!

## Legal

It is important to make sure that your contributions are not breaking any existing copyright agreements or licensing!

Contributions - code or assets - that are covered by licensing/copyright should be covered by a license/agreement that
explicitly allows freedom of use, and does not impose any charges/costs.

By default, you retain your rights to self-made contributions. By contributing code or assets, it is assumed that you
are allowing unconditional free use of your contribution, free of charge.

### Code

You may express your wishes or insert any legal text regarding contributed code using comments, according to the
applicable [style guidelines](#style-guides)!

### Assets

You may express your wishes or insert any legal text regarding contributed assets by adding them to a ***LEGAL file***
in the directory that holds your contribution.

The contents of a `LEGAL` file (*just `LEGAL`, in capital letters, without any extension*) should be as follows:

```txt
-RESOURCE-NAME: <item>
-RESOURCE-NAME: <item>
...
-RESOURCE-LEGAL-TEXT
<legal-text>
```

- `<item>`: The file name (including the extension) within the directory. You may use an asterisk (`*`) to cover all
files within the current directory under a license/copyright/note.
- `<legal-text>`: The contents of the license/copyright/note

A clear example:

```txt
-RESOURCE-NAME: image.png
-RESOURCE-LEGAL-TEXT
Copyright (c) 2024 Your Name
This software is licensed under the MIT License


-RESOURCE-NAME: file1.png
-RESOURCE-NAME: file2.png
-RESOURCE-NAME: file3.png
-RESOURCE-LEGAL-TEXT
Copyright (c) 2024 Some Company
This software is licensed under the MIT License
```
