# General Programs and Commands

## `7z` command

On windows, you must [install 7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) first!
After doing so, add the installation path of your program to your [Windows `PATH` environment variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14))!

On linux, you can simply use normal commands:

```bash
sudo apt install p7zip-full  # Install the full package (includes 7z)
```
