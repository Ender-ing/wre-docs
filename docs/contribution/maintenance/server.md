# Server Updates

In order to apply your local changes to the server, you must first use the
[`BUILT.bat` command](https://github.com/Ender-ing/render-activity/blob/main/BUILD.bat)
(***only on Windows***) to build a ready-to-host version of the codebase.

:::note
This documentation is meant to instruct individuals with access to the
[server terminal](https://terminal.ender.ing/) and [private repositories](./../intro.md#projects)!
:::

After the output of this command is generated, you should navigate to the output directory, and commit your changes to
the [`host` GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ender-ing/host/).

:::note
If you do not have access to that repository, but still wish to contribute, you may ask the maintainers to accept your
contribution in the dedicated public repository related to your contribution, so they may build a new host codebase.
:::

After the commit is accepted, you may use the server terminal to publish the changes.

## First time use _(in-progress)_

If you're building the codebase for the first time, you must use the *collection command* in order to collect all
repositories in one folder!

## Server Terminal

After logging into the [server terminal](https://terminal.ender.ing/), you may use the most fitting command to
publish changes:

### Server-side changes

If the changes within the codebase only relate to server-side code, you may use the `get` command to fetch changes.

### Client-side changes

If the changes within the codebase affect client-side code (*JavaScript, CSS, Display files, etc.*), you may use
the `full` command to fetch changes and purge the global cache.

:::tip
If you believe that the client-side changes are not large, or in case of server-side updates, you may just use
the `get` command, without purging the global cache.
:::

## Versioning

By default, any changes to the codebase of a service/root directory will trigger a version increment.

If you wish to generate a new build without automatically updating the version of the codebase, you may use
the `--no-auto-update` flag:

```batch
BUILD.bat --no-auto-update
```

If you wish to manually update all global versions (an example use case would be when a non-local shared resource is
updated), you may use the following flags:

```batch
:: Increase major version by 1
BUILD.bat --major
:: Increase minor version by 1
BUILD.bat --minor
:: Increase patch version by 1
BUILD.bat --patch
```

If you wish to delete generated versioning files, you may use the
[RESET-VERSION.bat](https://github.com/Ender-ing/render-activity/blob/main/RESET-VERSION.bat)
command:

```batch
RESET-VERSION.bat
```
