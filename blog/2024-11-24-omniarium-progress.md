A notice regarding the current development direction for Omniarium:

<!-- truncate -->

Currently, the only aspect of Omniarium that is under development is the syntax of the language!
(relating to the Lexer and Parser only)

**No more advancement will be made until I get more familiar with C++ and ANTLR4 development**
(this is done to avoid being forced to rewrite the whole Omni development kit later down the line)

For now, I'll also work on another project that also requires the use of these technologies.
(It'll be my Frankenstein for ANTLR4 and C++)

This new project is a transpiler for command line scripts that compiles the new custom *PolarFrankie command line
scripting language* into *Bash* and *Batch* script files that are safe to run as building scripts for projects.

If PolarFrankie is found to be stable enough, all already-written build batch files will be converted into PolarFrankie
scripts to support builds on Linux too!

If all goes well, after getting a firm idea of how best to proceed with the development of Omni to the best of my
abilities, I'll continue the development of Omni further past the parsing stage!
